The investigational product is called BIOPIN. It is a small implant that is inserted just under the skin of the thigh and slowly releases medication over many months. The goal of the study is to see what the blood levels of naltrexone are from two different doses of the BIOPIN implant over time and to compare it to blood levels of naltrexone from Vivitrol®, an FDA-approved injectable form of extended-release naltrexone given once a month.

This study will enroll healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 55. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a low dose BIOPIN implant, a high dose BIOPIN implant, or monthly Vivitrol injections. All participants will be followed closely for 12 months to monitor medication levels in their blood and assess for any side effects or health changes. The study will help determine if the BIOPIN implant can deliver naltrexone levels that are equal to or higher than those seen with monthly Vivitrol injections, particularly during the times when patients are most vulnerable to relapse.

Participants receiving the BIOPIN implant will have the option of having the implant removed at the end of the study or choosing to continue being observed until the implant fully dissolves, which may take up to two years. Participants who choose extended follow-up will be enrolled in a separate observational study.

Participants are put into 2 groups randomly, which means by chance. One group takes vicadrostat and empagliflozin tablets, and the other group takes placebo tablets with empagliflozin. Placebo tablets look like vicadrostat tablets but do not contain any medicine.

Participants take a tablet once per day for 2 and a half years and up to 4 years and 3 months. All participants also continue their medication for type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease. Participants have an equal chance of receiving the study medicine or placebo.

Participants are in the study for up to 4 years and 3 months. During this time, they visit the study site regularly. During these visits, doctors collect information about participants' health and take blood samples. The doctors document when participants experience cardiovascular events. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects.",NO,"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2|Hypertension|Cardiovascular Diseases",DRUG: Vicadrostat|DRUG: Empagliflozin|DRUG: Placebo matching Vicadrostat,"Time to first event of cardiovascular (CV) death or heart failure event (HFE), Up to 51 months","Time to first event of cardiovascular (CV) death or hospitalisation for heart failure (HHF), Up to 51 months|Absolute change from baseline in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) [mmHg] at Week 24, At baseline and week 24|Relative change from baseline in Urine Albumin Creatinine Ratio (UACR) [mg/g] at Week 24, At baseline and week 24|Time to first occurrence of the composite outcome of kidney disease progression, HHF, CV death, Up to 51 months|Time to first event of CV death, HFE, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or non-fatal stroke (4-point Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)), Up to 51 months|Occurrences of all-cause hospitalisations (first and recurrent), Up to 51 months|Time to first event of new-onset atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (in participants without history of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter) or CV death, Up to 51 months|Time to all-cause death, Up to 51 months|Time to CV death, Up to 51 months|Time to first HHF, Up to 51 months|Time to first event of new-onset HF or CV death, Up to 51 months|Occurrences of HHF (first and recurrent), Up to 51 months|Absolute change from baseline in mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) [mmHg] at Week 24, At baseline and week 24",,Boehringer Ingelheim,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,11800,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",1378-0041|U1111-1319-9064|2025-521188-11-00,2025-07-28,2029-12-14,2029-12-21,2025-07-14,,2025-07-14,"Pinnacle Research Group, LLC, Anniston, Alabama, 36207, United States|Eastern Shore Research Group, Fairhope, Alabama, 36532, United States|The Institute for Liver Health, LLC, Chandler, Arizona, 85225, United States|Elite Clinical Studies, Phoenix, Arizona, 85018, United States|Clinical Research Institute of Arizona, LLC, Sun City West, Arizona, 85375, United States|CCT Research -

However, there are situations in which these procedures face limitations, such as the evaluation of indeterminate ductal strictures or the management of complex choledocholithiasis.

Direct visualization of the biliary and pancreatic ducts has proven to be a useful and effective alternative in such cases. It also has a safety profile comparable to conventional ERCP, with only a slight increase in the incidence of adverse events.

Nevertheless, due to the associated increase in costs, most centers have adopted a stepwise approach in their diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms, using this technique only after multiple ERCPs.

Although the evidence is still limited, recent studies suggest that early use of direct cholangiopancreatoscopy could be a cost-effective strategy due to its increased efficacy.

In this regard, collecting data on direct cholangiopancreatoscopy would be of interest to generate robust conclusions on cost-effectiveness in routine clinical practice.

Study Objectives

The primary goal is to identify prognostic and predictive factors that can enhance the clinical and therapeutic management of thyroid cancer patients at any disease stage. The analysis aims to integrate biological tumor characteristics with clinical and therapeutic data to identify significant correlations between these parameters and disease progression.

Study Design and Patient Cohorts

The study includes two distinct cohorts:

Historical (retrospective) cohort: This group includes patients previously treated for thyroid neoplasms from January 1, 2010, to the date of study approval. Data from these patients will be analyzed to evaluate long-term outcomes and identify potential predictors of treatment response.

Prospective cohort: This group includes patients newly diagnosed with thyroid cancer who will be enrolled over a 60-month period from the study's approval. These patients will undergo systematic monitoring to assess disease progression and therapy effectiveness.

Data Collection and Analysis

The study will collect and examine data on:

Clinical characteristics: Including sex, age at diagnosis, comorbidities, hereditary syndromes, and performance status.

Laboratory data: Including tumor markers and metabolic parameters relevant to disease characterization.

Anatomopathological aspects: Such as histological tumor type, pathological staging, lymphovascular or perineural invasion, and other indicators of tumor aggressiveness.

Molecular profiles: Evaluated through genetic alterations and biomarkers with potential prognostic and predictive value.

Statistical and Methodological Approach

An advanced statistical approach will be used to assess the impact of collected variables on patient outcomes. The analysis will include:

Comparative analyses of patient groups based on clinical and biological characteristics.

Survival analysis, estimating overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests.

Multivariate regression models to identify independent factors associated with prognosis and treatment response.

Ethical Considerations and Regulatory Compliance

The study will be conducted in compliance with ethical and regulatory guidelines, including the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) by ICH, and Italian regulations on observational studies. Patient data will be anonymized and securely stored, ensuring confidentiality.

As a non-interventional study, no experimental drugs or procedures will be administered. However, molecular and immunohistochemical analyses will be performed on tumor tissue samples already available or collected during standard clinical practice.

Study Timeline and Expected Outcomes

The prospective cohort enrollment will continue until 2029, after which statistical analyses will be completed, and study results will be published. The collected data will provide valuable insights for optimizing the clinical management of thyroid cancer patients, supporting the development of increasingly personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",NO,Carcinoma of Head/Neck,,"overall survival, The time interval (expressed in months) between the date of disease diagnosis and the date of death from any cause.

This study evaluates a novel method of free gingival graft (FGG) deepithelialization using an Er,Cr:YSGG laser (LDEE) for treating multiple gingival recessions. Methods: A split-mouth study was conducted on 46 (n=46) recessions in 9 patients (23 per test and control group). Sites were randomized. Full-thickness palatal grafts were harvested with a scalpel. In the test group (LDEE), deepithelialization was performed extraorally using an Er,Cr:YSGG laser (2780 nm; 2.5 W, 83.3 mJ, 30 Hz, 600 µm tip). In the control group (DEE), a 15c scalpel was used. All CTGs were applied using the modified coronally advanced tunnel (TUN) technique. Clinical parameters-recession depth (RD), keratinized tissue width (KT), gingival thickness (GT), pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), pink esthetic score (PES), approximal plaque index (API), mean root coverage (MRC), and complete root coverage (CRC)-were assessed at baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), and 6 months (T2). Results: Both LDEE and DEE groups showed significant improvements in RD, KT, GT, PD, and CAL over time (p \< 0.001). At T1 and T2, KT was significantly higher in the LDEE group (T1: 3.73±0.72 mm; T2: 3.98±0.76 mm) compared to the DEE group (T1: 3.21±0.61 mm; T2: 3.44±0.74 mm; p \< 0.05).

NCT07064148,The Effects of Self-Myofascial Release on Physical Fitness and Swing Performance in Male Collegiate Golfers in China,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07064148,,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"This is a randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effects of a self-myofascial release (SMR) program on physical fitness and swing performance in male collegiate golfers in China. The primary purpose is to determine whether SMR, using foam rollers and massage balls, can improve joint mobility, core control, balance, and golf-specific swing outcomes.

The study seeks to answer the following key questions:

Can an 8-week SMR program enhance physical functions such as mobility, balance, and trunk control in male collegiate golfers?

Can SMR improve key performance indicators of golf swing, including club head speed, ball speed, carry distance, and accuracy?

Participants (n=60) will be healthy male collegiate golfers aged 18-25, randomly assigned to either an experimental group (SMR) or a time-matched control group (no SMR). Both groups will undergo 8 weeks of golf training in a centralized camp with identical accommodations and practice schedules.

The SMR group will perform supervised self-myofascial release exercises using Decathlon-brand foam rollers and balls, three times per week (30 min/session) in the gym after regular training.

The control group will engage in supervised 30-minute sessions of passive golf-related video watching, scheduled at the same time and environment as the SMR sessions.

Assessments will be conducted at Week 0 (baseline), Week 4 (midpoint), and Week 8 (post-intervention). Testing will include range-of-motion (ROM) measurements, balance tasks, strength/stability exercises, and golf swing performance using a TrackMan Launch Monitor. All outcome assessors will be blinded to group allocation to minimize bias.

All tests were completed by the same trained evaluator using standardized protocols to ensure measurement consistency., Week 0 (Pre-test): 1 day before the intervention Week 4 (Mid-test): Day 28 ± 2 Week 9 (Post-test): 2 days after the final SMR session|Shoulder External Rotation Range of Motion (Active, Supine, 90° Abduction), Active shoulder external rotation ROM was assessed with participants in a supine position, shoulder abducted to 90° and elbow flexed to 90°, with the upper arm supported on the table edge. Participants were instructed to actively rotate their forearm backward (external rotation) as far as possible without lifting the scapula or arching the back. A digital goniometer (Lafayette Instrument Co., Model 01135, ±1° accuracy) was used. The axis was placed on the olecranon, the stationary arm was perpendicular to the floor, and the movable arm aligned with the ulna. The examiner applied light manual contact on the anterior shoulder to prevent compensation. Two trials were recorded, and the average was used for analysis. All tests were performed by the same evaluator under standardized conditions., Week 0 (Pre-test): 1 day before intervention Week 4 (Mid-test): Day 28 ± 2 Week 9 (Post-test): 2 days after final SMR session|Wrist Extension Range of Motion (Active, Seated, Neutral Forearm), Active wrist extension ROM was measured with participants seated and their forearm in a neutral position (thumb up), elbow flexed at 90°, and hand over the table edge. Participants were instructed to extend their wrist upward as far as possible without moving their elbow, shoulder, or fingers. A digital goniometer (Lafayette Instrument Co., Model 01135, ±1° accuracy) was used. The axis was placed over the triquetrum, the stationary arm aligned with the ulna, and the movable arm along the fifth metacarpal. Two trials were recorded, and the average was used. A single trained evaluator conducted all tests under standardized conditions., Week 0 (Pre-test): 1 day before intervention Week 4 (Mid-test): Day 28 ± 2 Week 9 (Post-test): 2 days after final SMR session|Single-Leg Stance Test (Eyes Closed) - Balance Time Measurement, Balance was assessed using the single-leg stance test with eyes closed. Participants stood barefoot on their dominant leg, arms crossed over the chest, and eyes gently closed. The non-stance leg was flexed at the knee so that the foot did not touch the ground. They were instructed to maintain balance as long as possible without moving the supporting foot, uncrossing their arms, or opening their eyes. The timing started once both eyes were fully closed and stopped when any of the following occurred: (1) the raised foot touched the ground, (2) arms moved from the chest, (3) the stance foot shifted, or (4) the eyes opened. A maximum time limit of 60 seconds was set. A stopwatch was used for timing, and one trained observer recorded each trial. Each participant performed two trials, and the longer duration was used for analysis. The same evaluator administered all tests to ensure consistency across sessions., Week 0 (Pre-test): 1 day before intervention Week 4 (Mid-test): Day 28 ± 2 Week 9 (Post-test): 2 days after the final SMR session|Standing Broad Jump - Lower-Body Explosive Power, Lower-body explosive power was evaluated using the Standing Broad Jump test. Participants stood barefoot behind a marked line with feet shoulder-width apart. They began in a semi-squat position with arms free to swing, then jumped forward maximally using a two-foot take-off and landing. The distance was measured from the starting line to the nearest heel mark on landing. A floor-mounted measuring tape recorded the result in centimeters. One practice attempt was allowed, followed by two measured trials. The longer valid jump was used for analysis. All tests were performed indoors on a non-slip surface under standardized conditions. A trained assessor ensured consistent instructions, proper technique, and accurate measurements across all participants., Week 0 (Pre-test): 1 day before intervention Week 4 (Mid-test): Day 28 ± 2 Week 9 (Post-test): 2 days after the final SMR session|Rotational Medicine Ball Throw Distance (3kg, Seated Side Throw), Upper-body rotational power was assessed using the seated rotational medicine ball throw test. Participants sat on the floor with their back firmly against a wall, legs extended and knees slightly bent to minimize lower-body involvement. Using their dominant arm, they held a 3kg soft medicine ball (Decathlon, diameter 19 cm) at chest level. On cue, they rotated the torso and forcefully threw the ball laterally in the direction of the dominant side. This setup focused the movement on trunk and upper-limb power while restricting contribution from the lower extremities. A measuring tape was laid along the floor in the throw direction, and throw distance was recorded from the wall to the point of first contact with the ground. Each participant completed one practice attempt, followed by two valid test trials. The longest of the two valid throws was used for analysis., Week 0 (Pre-test): 1 day before intervention Week 4 (Mid-test): Day 28 ± 2 Week 9 (Post-test): 2 days after final SMR session|Cross-Body Reach Test (High Plank, 30-Second Repetition Count), Core coordination and shoulder stability were assessed using the Cross-Body Reach Test. Participants held a high plank position on a flat, non-slip indoor surface, with hands directly under the shoulders, elbows extended, and feet hip-width apart. Maintaining a straight line from head to heels, they were instructed to alternately lift one hand and tap the opposite shoulder (e.g., right hand to left shoulder), then return it to the ground, continuing the movement for 30 seconds.

Each successful tap was counted as one repetition. The total number of valid repetitions performed within the 30-second period was recorded. A trained evaluator ensured correct form and consistency, counting only those repetitions that met the standard. Participants completed one practice trial before testing. This test emphasized neuromuscular control, core stability, and dynamic upper-limb coordination., Week 0 (Pre-test): 1 day before intervention Week 4 (Mid-test): Day 28 ± 2 Week 9 (Post-test): 2 days after final SMR session",,Yang Qi,,MALE,ADULT,NA,30,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE,2025011,2025-08-01,2025-10-01,2025-10-02,2025-07-14,,2025-07-14,"Hainan Normal University, Haikou, Hainan, 570100, China",

NCT07064083,The Effect of Intra-Canal Ketorolac Application on Post-Endodontic Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07064083,Post-Endodonti,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"After obtaining informed consent, the procedure begins with the administration of local anesthesia to ensure patient comfort. A standard approach involves using 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, delivered either via infiltration for maxillary teeth or mental nerve block for mandibular posterior teeth. Adequate anesthesia is confirmed using a cold test or gentle probing. Once profound anesthesia is achieved, rubber dam isolation is placed to maintain an aseptic field and prevent contamination. The operative field is then disinfected with 5% sodium hypochlorite before proceeding to the access cavity preparation.

The access cavity is prepared using a high-speed diamond bur under continuous water coolant. The shape of the access cavity is determined by the tooth's anatomy, ensuring straight-line access to the canal system. Once the pulp chamber is opened, the roof is carefully removed using a round bur or ultrasonic tips, exposing the canal orifices. The chamber is then thoroughly irrigated with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite to remove any residual pulp tissue and debris. A DG16 endodontic explorer is used to locate the canal orifices, after which initial canal exploration is performed using a #10 or #15 K-file to check for patency.

Working length determination follows, utilizing an electronic apex locator (EAL) to establish the length of the canal. A confirmation periapical radiograph is taken to verify the readings. To maintain apical patience, a #10 K-file is used in a gentle watch-winding motion until it reaches the apical constriction. The glide path is then established to facilitate subsequent instrumentation. This is achieved by sequentially using hand files (#10, 15, and 20 K-files) with a balanced force technique until a #20 file moves freely to the working length. Throughout this process, frequent irrigation with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite is performed to flush out debris and maintain canal cleanliness.

Once the glide path is established, shaping of the canal begins based on the size of the initial binding file, which is the first file to engage the canal walls at the working length. If the initial binding file is #10 or #15, the apical preparation is typically completed up to a size #35, while an initial binding file of #20 may require enlargement to #40 or #50. Canal shaping is performed using a crown-down technique with rotary nickel-titanium (NiTi) instruments.

Throughout the shaping process, continuous irrigation with sodium hypochlorite to dissolve organic debris and disinfect the canal is performed with total volume of 10ml/canal. After the final shaping, the canal is dried with sterile paper points, leaving it ready for medication placement. For the subjects of GI and GII, nano-ketorolac gel and ketorolac gel respectively (Around 2mm3), placed as medicament inside the root canal while those of GIII a placebo gel is placed. Both will be retained for one week. The obturation through cold lateral compaction technique is to be carried out on the next visit.

Randomization and Blinding:

Randomization will be performed using a computer-generated sequence. The patients and outcome assessors will be blinded to the group allocation. Nano-ketorolac production

This study, a formulation containing Ketorolac Tromethamine (KT) at a concentration of 10 mg/mL were developed using Compritol 888 as distinct oleaginous phases. Span 60 was incorporated as a surfactant at a concentration of 1.5%, while the drug-to-oleaginous phase ratio was maintained at 1:2. The Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLNs) were formulated using high-shear homogenization to ensure optimal particle size and stability. The nano-Ketorolac will be manufactured in the college of phramaceutical sciences and drug manufacturing, Misr University for Science and Technology, , Egypt.

Statistical Analysis Data will be analyzed using SPSS software. Data will be tested for its normal distribution; accordingly, the appropriate test will be conducted. Statistical significance will be set at p \< 0.05.

Furthermore, we would like to see if using this non-drug treatment option might allow for the same or better control of nausea and vomiting with fewer side effects than the current medications used. This may decrease drowsiness, and allow for earlier mobility, increase comfort, and generally accelerate recovery after surgery.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does the use of Reletex Reliefband decrease postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the Bariatric surgical patient, therefore decreasing need for additional anti-emetics.
* Does the use of Reletex Reliefband the use of the Reletex Reliefband during the immediate post-operative period reduce PONV, allowing for early mobility, decreased pain and length of stay (LOS).
* Does the use of Reletex Reliefband decrease the use of medications for nausea and therefore decrease costs.
* Does the use of Reletex Reliefband reduce prolonged PONV and therefore prevent the downstream effects, i.e. less mobility, increased pain, inhibit the patients' ability to comply with recommended treatments.
* If reducing PONV using non-pharmaceutical approaches will improve outcomes and patient experiences.

Researchers will compare to a placebo (a look-alike device) to see if the Reletex Reliefband works to decrease PONV.

Similarly, another study found that variability in motor and cognitive development could be better explained by environmental factors and parental knowledge and practices. It has also been shown that the opportunities provided in the home environment of preterm infants may be associated with motor development and sensory processing skills. In the literature, it is generally observed that studies evaluate either term infants or both preterm and term infants together. In the present study, however, infants at developmental risk and typically developing infants will be evaluated separately.

The aim of this study is to assess whether infants at developmental risk are disadvantaged in terms of their home environment.

The hypotheses of this study are as follows:

Exercise is one of the most powerful medical therapies available, with numerous proven benefits to patients with diseases like diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Despite this, exercise is not currently used in patients with liver failure or recovering from LT, due to a lack of robust evidence. Exercise may have the potential to improve the lives of people with liver disease and reduce the side-effects of LT surgery.

NCT07063914,Stepped-Care School-Based Intervention for Adolescent Suicidal Ideation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07063914,,RECRUITING,"Background. Suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms are highly prevalent among adolescents, with suicide representing a leading cause of death in this age group worldwide. School-based indicated prevention programs using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have shown promise in addressing these mental health challenges. The Reframe-IT+ (Chile) and CARIBOU (Canada) programs are CBT-based, individually delivered interventions targeting adolescents at risk of suicide. This study aims to evaluate a culturally adapted stepped-care model using these two interventions, matched to depressive symptom severity.

Methods. This is a quasi-experimental, single-arm study with pre-post assessments and follow-ups at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Six secondary schools with high socioeconomic vulnerability in Santiago, Chile, will participate. Students with suicidal ideation and mild/moderate depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 \< 20) will be offered Reframe-IT+, while those with severe symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 20) will be offered CARIBOU. Primary outcomes include the acceptability of CARIBOU, feasibility of the stepped-care model, and implementation fidelity. Secondary outcomes include reductions in suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, hopelessness, and improvements in functioning, quality of life, behavioral activation, emotional regulation, and problem-solving skills.

Discussion. This protocol addresses the need for scalable, culturally sensitive interventions for adolescent suicide prevention in school settings. By evaluating both the process and early outcomes of a stepped-care approach, this study will generate valuable evidence to inform future large-scale effectiveness trials and policy development in adolescent mental health.",NO,Suicidal Ideation,BEHAVIORAL: Reframe-IT and CARIBOU,"Acceptability of the CARIBOU Program, Acceptability will be assessed by examining how well the intervention is received by student participants and facilitators, and how well it addresses the needs of the target population. Upon completion of the program, participants will complete a general acceptability questionnaire and a module-specific acceptability questionnaire. Facilitators will complete a general acceptability questionnaire as well. All instruments were developed by the research team and are designed to measure the program's content in detail.

Additionally, the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) will be used to assess overall satisfaction with the intervention (19). The CSQ-8 consists of 8 Likert-scale items with four response options, and includes open fields for comments and suggestions.

NCT07063862,Psilocybin Microdose for Psychological and Existential Distress in Palliative Care (PSYCHED-PAL-RCT),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07063862,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"About 30-50% of patients with advanced illness experience depression, anxiety, or decreased sense of purpose and autonomy. Together, these are called psychological distress. Treatment options such as medication and therapy are available; however, they do not always work and can be time-consuming and expensive. We need treatments that work well, quickly, and can be available to all patients with advanced illness who have psychological distress.

Psilocybin, a psychedelic medication (commonly called 'magic mushrooms') works well for improving psychological distress in people with cancer or chronic illness when given in high doses with specific forms of therapy. However, psilocybin has not been well-studied among people with advanced illness, and there are concerns about safety and side effects in people approaching the end of life.

However, reports on psilocybin microdosing, which involves taking small doses that do not cause hallucinations and do not require therapy, suggest that this may be effective, safer, and more acceptable for people with advanced illness. We recently completed a small study of psilocybin microdosing. Our results showed psilocybin microdose improved psychological distress in most participants with advanced illness, without serious side effects. Our next step is to do a randomized clinical trial where some patients receive psilocybin microdose and some receive placebo (a drug that contains no medicinal ingredients). By comparing these two groups, we can remove the possibility that improvements in symptoms are only because patients thought they were getting treatment.

We will enroll 120 patients from inpatient, outpatient, and community care settings across seven sites.

NCT07063771,Safety and Clinical Efficacy of Histotripsy for Liver Cancers Adjacent to Major Intrahepatic Vessels,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07063771,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Malignant liver tumors are among the most common malignancies worldwide, with over 10,000 new cases diagnosed annually in Taiwan. Despite the variety of treatment options currently available for malignant liver tumors, the prognosis for patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma or metastatic liver cancer remains disheartening. More than 8,000 people die from the disease each year. The majority of patients (approximately 70% to 85%) are diagnosed at an advanced stage or have tumors that are unresectable. In contrast, patients with smaller tumors have a much better chance of achieving a cure. Numerous studies have reported that patients who undergo hepatic lobectomy have a 5-year disease-free survival rate exceeding 50%. For tumors that are not surgically resectable, local ablation techniques such as Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) have emerged as potentially curative alternatives. However, RFA has significant drawbacks: its percutaneous invasiveness can sometimes lead to bleeding or tumor seeding along the needle tract, and it may be less effective near blood vessels due to the heat-sink effect. Therefore, its application is currently limited to small liver tumors. Histotripsy is a tumor ablation technique developed in recent years that allows for non-invasive treatment of solid tumors using High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU). This method works by physically focusing ultrasound energy at a single point within biological tissue, creating a focal zone of high-power, low-frequency ultrasound that induces mechanical fragmentation (histotripsy) and cavitation effects, dissolving the tissue into fragments and destroying tumor cells. Under real-time ultrasound imaging guidance, various scanning treatment protocols are used to move the focal point throughout the treatment zone, effectively ablating the tumor tissue. This clinical trial utilizes the Edison System, developed by HistoSonics Inc. (USA). The first multicenter Phase I human trial of this technology was conducted in 2018, lasting eight weeks and treating 11 patients with advanced, unresectable multifocal liver tumors. All targeted tumors were successfully ablated with no device-related adverse events. This research project aims to evaluate the clinical feasibility and advantages of this system in malignant liver tumor patients who are ineligible for surgical resection but are still candidates for local tumor ablation.

NCT07063719,Identification of Cellular Biomarkers of Rare Eye Diseases in Adults,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07063719,REVIBIO,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The cornea is the outermost transparent 'window' of the eye allowing light to enter and serving as the first-line immune and mechanical barrier. It is a complex avascular tissue composed of cells, stem cells, nerves, and collagen layers organized in an exquisite manner to maintain its transparency and self-healing capacity. This delicately balanced interplay of corneal elements is disrupted in rare diseases of the cornea, resulting in non-healing wounds, corneal ulceration, inflammation, new vessel ingrowth (neovascularization), defective innervation, scarring, oedema and loss of transparency. For many Rare Eye Diseases (REDs), drug development has been relatively unsuccessful, delivering few to no new therapies. Current management is often prohibitively expensive, has low efficacy and leads to debilitating side effects. The RESTORE VISION project (https://restorevision-project.eu/) aims to improve eye health by using cutting-edge models for each rare disease to test novel and repurposed compounds (9 in total) and determine drug mechanisms of action, formulating compounds as safe eye drop suspensions, and performing several first-in-human trials of novel therapies. Thes drugs have solid preliminary data showing beneficial effects in restoring the cell physiology, immune, avascular, neural and signaling environment in the cornea.

The current clinical study is part of Work package 2 within the RESTORE VISION EU grant agreement (''Validation of human drug targets of repurposed drugs and novel therapies'') and aims to ascertain the expression levels of genes and proteins and investigate pathways of interest in human tissue and fluid samples of REDs, that are targeted by the proposed experimental/repurposed substances. Therapeutic target gene and/or protein expression will be verified in human blood, tears and conjunctival cells collected from 7 RED patient groups. The RESTORE VISION Consortium know multiple putative genes and proteins involved in the REDs and/or affected by the drugs to be tested in RED models. These will be analyzed in patient samples from the 7 REDs to see if they are 1) expressed at all; 2) differ in expression between patient and control group and 3) are correlated with clinical endpoints and/or symptoms of REDs.

The 7 REDs under investigation are briefly explained as follows:

1. AAK: genetic progressive limbal stem cell degeneration leading to corneal neovascularization, inflammation, recurrent erosions, chronic pain and vision loss.
2. OCP: autoimmune scarring of the conjunctiva leads to deficient wound healing, inflammation, scarring, blindness and pain.
3. EEC Syndrome: Ectodermal Dysplasia causes pathological corneal scarring and blindness.
4. NK: involves a corneal nerve deficit leading to reduction or loss of corneal sensitivity, impaired wound healing, corneal ulceration and loss of vision.
5. LSCD: acquired or hereditary stem cell deficiency inducing epithelial breakdown, neovascularization, scarring and inflammation leading to decreased vision, tearing and pain.
6. oGvHD: a severe side-effect of successful bone-marrow transplantation leads to painful and blinding ocular surface inflammation, neovascularization and delayed wound healing.
7. CN: in high-risk transplantation, pathologic inflammation, corneal blood and lymphatic vessels are key risk factors for high-risk corneal graft failure, leading to graft rejection and blindness.",NO,Rare Diseases|Ophthalmology,OTHER: Ophthalmological visit|OTHER: Questionnaires|OTHER: Blood sample collection|OTHER: Impression cytology|OTHER: Tear fluid,"The expression levels of the genes and proteins, The primary endpoint will be the expression levels of the genes and proteins listed in the Study description. These genes and proteins are expected to be differentially expressed (upregulated or down regulated) compared to the control group. The investigators will arbitrarily set at 1 the target level in the control group and the RED group will be expressed in relation to the control group.

While sample collection occurs in 4 Clinical centers (2 in Inserm, France, 1 in Klinikum der Universitaet zu Koeln (UKK, Germany) and 1 in San Raffaele Hospital OSR, Italy), following any initial required processing all samples will be shipped to OSR in Italy who will perform the qPCR, Elisa and/or Mass Spectrometry analysis.

NCT07063680,Efficacy of Early Argipressin in the Management of Intensive Care Patients With Norepinephrine-refractory Vasoplegic Shock,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07063680,Vaso²R,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Acute circulatory failure (shock) is defined as insufficient oxygen transport to meet the oxygen requirements of organs and tissues. Vasoplegic shock is the most frequent cause of shock, defined by vasoplegia and a drop in arterial pressure with preserved cardiac output. The main aetiologies of vasoplegic shock are sepsis and post-operative vasoplegia. Symptomatic treatment of vasoplegic shock is based on vasopressors. The first-line vasopressor is norepinephrine. Refractory vasoplegic shock refers as high norepinephrine requirements. In patients with catecholamine-refractory vasoplegia, the use of vasopressin as a second-line treatment is proposed. The use of vasopressin could improve organ and tissue perfusion, improve renal function, accelerate shock reversal and reduce patients' exposure to catecholamines, and thus to their side effects.

Currently, there is a gap between evidence and guidelines/practice regarding vasopressin in patients with refractory vasoplegic shock:

1. There are no large randomized control trial focusing on vasopressin use in patients with refractory vasoplegic shock and data extrapolated from non-refractory shock have contradictory conclusions regarding the benefit of vasopressin in this population.
2. In patients with vasoplegic shock, expert often recommend vasopressin as second line vasopressor and, in the case of septic shock, current international guidelines clearly position vasopressin as second-line therapy in septic shock and advocate its initiation in patients with vasoplegia refractory to norepinephrine.

The strengh of those recommendation is weak due to moderate quality of evidence highlighting the need to conduct a large randomized control trial on this topic.

We hypothesize that the use of vasopressin in patients with refractory vasoplegic shock may improve 30-day survival, decrease renal replacement therapy and reduce duration of vasopressor administration. This is the first multicentred study aiming to confirm the superiority of vasopressin in combination with norepinephrine over norepinephrine alone in this population.",NO,Patients With Norepinephrine-refractory Vasoplegic Shock,DRUG: Argipressin|DRUG: Chlorure de sodium|OTHER: Collection of clinical data,"The mortality rate, in order to determine whether the administration of vasopressin in addition to norepinephrine improves survival, At Day 30|The use of renal replacement therapy within 30 days post-inclusion, in order to determine whether the administration of vasopressin in addition to norepinephrine improves renal function, At Day 30|The persistence of vasopressor use within 15 days post-inclusion, to determine whether the administration of vasopressin in addition to norepinephrine reduce the duration of shock, At Day 15",,,Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Dijon,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,390,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",NGUYEN PHRCN 2023,2025-09,2028-05,2028-05,2025-07-14,,2025-07-14,"CHU Dijon Bourgogne, Dijon, 21000, France",

Aim :The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of Gluma, Bioactive Glass and combination of both, compared to Flouride Varnish on the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity of cervical non-carious lesions in adult Population over six months.

The study will enroll 40 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. Each patient will contribute one tooth with complaints that meet the inclusion criteria, resulting in a total of 40 included teeth. The teeth will be categorized into Four groups based on the type of desensitizer used.

* Group 1 (G1); patients will be randomly assigned to Gluma.
* Group 2 (G2); patients will be randomly assigned to Bioactive Glass Powder.
* Group 3 (G3); patients will be randomly assigned to combination of both materials, Gluma and Bioactive Glass powder
* Group 4 (G4); patients will be randomly assigned to the Fluoride Varnish. For each patient, a sensitivity test will be conducted using a Visual Analog Scale immediately after desensitizer application, as well as at three months and six months post-application.

Clinical procedures:

The study will involve applying a controlled air stimulus (evaporative) to the complaining tooth. This will be done using a dental syringe adjusted to 40-65 psi, directed perpendicular at a distance of 1-3 mm from the exposed dentin. Subsequently, the patient will indicate the level of sensitivity on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) chart ranging from 0 to 10, with a focus on instances where the VAS score exceeds 4. To facilitate the patient's expression of pain intensity, a plastic card featuring figures with facial expressions, color-coded, and numbered, will be utilized. This visual aid aims to streamline the process of discerning and recording the degree of pain experienced by the patient.

For Gluma group

Each sensitive tooth will be cleaned with a polishing paste, rinsed with water and air dried. Two coats of Gluma Desensitizer will be applied using a disposable brush applicator following the manufacturer's instructions and left untouched for 30-60 minutes.

For Bioactive Glass group :

To maintain a dry and clear field of vision, cheek retractors and high-volume suction will be employed during the procedure. High-volume suction, featuring a 45-degree beveled end, will be strategically positioned at the incisal or occlusal part of the teeth. This placement is designed to efficiently remove any particles, preventing the patient from swallowing them and minimizing the risk of minor injuries resulting from a forceful powder and water stream. The NSK Prophymate Neo will be utilized to dispense Sylc dry powder, which comprises calcium sodium phosphosilicate, onto the sensitive areas. The air stream will be carefully adjusted to 40-46 psi in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The handpiece will be maintained at a constant distance of 3-4 mm from the tooth surface, positioned at 60-80 degrees on the buccal surfaces. To prevent gingival injury, the tip of the handpiece will be directed incisally during application. The powder will be applied for 5-10 seconds per tooth, using a circular motion.

For the combined group (Bioactive Glass + Gluma) A combination of both Gluma and bioactive glass powder will be applied to the assigned teeth.

For the comparator group :

The teeth will undergo a thorough cleaning process using a polishing brush without any paste, and the surfaces will be subsequently air-dried. The application of a single dose of Bifluorid 10 (by VOCO) will be carried out using a micro brush. A thin coat of varnish will be applied to the tooth surface, and it will be left in place for 10-20 seconds before being air-dried.

NCT07063394,Evaluation of Virtual Reality for Reducing Opioid Use After Cardiac and Thoracic Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07063394,VR-Opioid-Post,RECRUITING,"This clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) as an adjunctive therapeutic method to reduce opioid consumption during the postoperative period of cardiac and thoracic surgeries. It is a single-center, prospective, randomized trial that will include 60 patients aged 16 to 40 undergoing surgeries such as valve replacements, pulmonary decortication, thoracic sympathectomies, and video-assisted thoracic procedures. Patients will be randomized into three groups:

Group 1: Standard anesthesia protocol combined with interactive VR therapy using games like Fruit Ninja 2, Beat Saber, and Oculus First Contact, as well as passive contemplation of immersive virtual environments (Blue Planet, Wander).

Group 2: Standard anesthesia protocol combined with VR therapy focusing solely on passive imagery, such as immersive 360° videos available on YouTube VR.

Group 3 (Control): Standard anesthesia protocol without any VR intervention.

The VR intervention will occur in three daily sessions lasting 30-45 minutes each, over the first five postoperative days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first. Training in VR equipment usage and full supervision by the study team will be provided throughout all sessions.

Primary Objective:

The primary goal is to reduce total opioid consumption, measured through medical prescriptions and patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump usage. Pain control will be assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).

Secondary Objectives:

Evaluate the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).

Measure the duration of mechanical and non-invasive ventilation.

Assess the length of stay in the ICU and the total hospital stay.

Record the occurrence of paralytic ileus.

Evaluate patient satisfaction.

Assess cognitive status using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).

Rationale:

Postoperative pain following cardiac and thoracic surgeries is commonly treated with opioids, which are associated with adverse effects such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and risk of dependency. Virtual reality offers an innovative approach to pain management by creating immersive environments that serve as cognitive distractions. This immersive distraction modulates pain perception, reduces anxiety, and enhances overall well-being. Prior studies have shown that VR can effectively reduce pain perception and improve patient satisfaction, supporting its potential as a non-pharmacological adjunct in various clinical contexts.

Methods:

Participants will undergo standardized surgical and anesthetic protocols at the Instituto do Coração (InCor) of the Hospital das Clínicas at the University of São Paulo. Clinical and demographic data will be collected, including opioid consumption, VAS pain scores, ventilatory parameters, and other relevant recovery indicators. Statistical analyses will include descriptive statistics, univariate comparisons, and multivariate logistic regression to identify significant associations between the interventions and outcomes. Analyses will be performed using SPSS, with statistical significance set at p \< 0.05.

Anticipated Outcomes:

The study anticipates that VR will significantly reduce postoperative opioid consumption, enhance pain control, and improve patient satisfaction. Additionally, patients exposed to VR may experience shorter hospital stays, reduced side effects, and better overall recovery metrics. If proven effective, VR could serve as a scalable, cost-effective, and safe complement to traditional postoperative pain management strategies, especially in populations where minimizing opioid use is a clinical priority.

NCT07063381,Low-frequency Electrical Stimulation for Cognitive Enhancement in Atrial Fibrillation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07063381,LESCAF,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Cognitive function in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is often impaired due to the complex influence of various factors (cerebral hypoperfusion, neurodegeneration, microemboli, hypertension, chronic inflammation). This leads to impairment of cognitive functions, including attention, memory, executive functions, and speed of information processing. The search for affordable and safe methods to maintain or improve cognitive function in this group of people is an urgent task of modern medicine. One of the promising approaches is percutaneous low-frequency electrical stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation - tVNS).

The auricular (auricular) branch of the vagus nerve is a peripheral branch of the vagus nerve innervating the skin of the auricle in the area of the tragus and the inner part of the external auditory canal. The tVNS engages the sensory fibres of the vagus nerve and thus mimics the sensory input to the brainstem, forming the so-called auriculo-vagal afferent pathway. Since these fibres project directly to the nucleus of the solitary pathway (solitary tract), which, in turn, has direct and indirect projections to the nuclei providing noradrenergic, endorphinergic and serotoninergic fibres in various parts of the brain regulating systemic indices of cardiovascular, respiratory and immunological functions, the organism's response to stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve is systemic in nature.

Stimulation of this nerve can modulate central nervous system (CNS) activity, affecting processes related to memory, attention and emotional state. Mechanisms of action of tVNS include modulation of parasympathetic activity, enhancement of neuroplasticity through increased expression of neurotrophic factors (e.g., BDNF), improvement of cerebral blood circulation, and regulation of neuroinflammation (reduction of proinflammatory cytokines).",NO,Cognitive Function Abnormal|Atrial Fibrillation (AF),DEVICE: tVNS,"Dynamics of neural activity of the brain., Changes in the characteristics of time-frequency analysis of the neural activity of the brain associated with the performance of a cognitive task., This parameter will be assessed at the beginning of the study (initially) and at the end of the study (6 months) in the active and fictitious stimulation groups.","Reaction Time (RT) Changes & EEG Correlates, Changes in reaction time (RT) during the perception and classification of ambiguous visual stimuli (Necker cubes) by a patient. The test is conducted with simultaneous EEG recording during the visual task (determining the orientation of the Necker cube - right-oriented or left-oriented configuration).

The presentation of ambiguous stimuli, such as the Necker cube, leads to an increase in reaction time due to the need to resolve perceptual conflict and make decisions under uncertainty. Parallel EEG recording reveals specific neural correlates of this process (N200 - conflict, P300 - decision/classification, frontal theta - cognitive control, gamma - perceptual reorganization), which are directly related to the observed changes in reaction speed. Analysis of these EEG markers together with RT provides deep insight into brain dynamics during the processing of ambiguous information., This parameter will be assessed at the beginning of the study (initially) and at the end of the study (6 months) in the active and fictitious stimulation groups.|Attention Level Changes & Error Rates, Changes in the level of attention during the perception and classification of ambiguous visual stimuli (Necker cubes) by a patient. The test is conducted with simultaneous EEG recording during the visual task (determining the orientation of the Necker cube - right-oriented or left-oriented configuration). The frequency of actual errors (incorrect reporting) is assessed.

NCT07063329,"An Open-label, Multicenter Phase Ib/II Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetic of PLB1004 Capsules Combined With Platinum-based Doublet Chemotherapy in Patients With EGFR Mutation Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07063329,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) that targets Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations. Unfortunately, despite the benefit observed for patients treated with EGFR-TKI, the vast majority of cancers are expected to develop resistance to the drug over time. The exact reasons why resistance develops are not fully understood but based upon clinical research it is hoped that combining PLB1004 with another type of anti-cancer therapy known as chemotherapy will delay the onset of resistance and the worsening of a patient's cancer.

In recent years, clinical studies on the combination of EGFR-TKI and chemotherapy have made important progress, suggesting that the combination of EGFR-TKI and chemotherapy further enhances the therapeutic benefit in EGFR-mutant positive NSCLC.

Both preclinical and clinical data indicate that PLB1004 exhibit good antitumor activity and relatively durable efficacy in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations. They can reduce tumor burden, control tumor progression, and improve the survival benefit of patients, which is expected to provide an effective treatment option for such patients.

This study is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion Ib/II phase study, aiming to evaluate the clinical safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary efficacy of PLB1004 combined with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations. The study consists of two parts: the phase Ib dose-escalation study and dose-expansion study, as well as the phase II clinical study. The target population of the phase Ib study is patients with confirmed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations who have received or not received systemic antitumor therapy. The II phase clinical study sets up two cohorts. Cohort 1: patients with confirmed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations who have received or not received systemic antitumor therapy; Cohort 2: patients with newly diagnosed resectable stage II-III NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations who have not received systemic antitumor therapy.
