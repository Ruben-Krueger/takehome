## AI-assistance

I didn't "vibe-code" this assignment. While vibe-coding is great for quickly creating MVPs, I wanted to be able to justify the technical choices made in this project. Additonally, I used tools/frameworks I was familiar with, so creating the skeleton of the project only took a few minutes.
