E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: The proposed study will test the feasibility of generating donor-derived cytomegalo virus (CMV)-specific T cells via the ex vivo introduction of a CMV-specific T cell receptor using a GMP grade retroviral vector. It will also determine the safety, toxicity (side effects) and efficacy of CMV TCR-transduced T cells used for the pre-emptive treatment of CMV reactivation following HLA-matched sibling Allo-Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.

Primary Objectives: 
(i) Evaluate the feasibility of retroviral-mediated TCR gene transfer to generate CMV-specific T cells from CMV seronegative donors; 
(ii) Evaluate the safety, toxicity and side effects of pre-emptive CMV TCR-transduced donor-derived T cells for immunotherapy after Allo-HSCT, where donors are CMV seronegative.

Primary Endpoints: 
(i) Document transduction efficiency and TCR expression on TCR-transduced T cells; (ii) Identify organ toxicities and other side effects.

We propose that CMV TCR-transduced T cells, generated from

•Be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures
•Be informed and understand the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to notify her study doctor immediately if there is a risk of pregnancy
•Understand the need to commence  lenalidomide as soon as it is dispensed following a negative pregnancy test
•Agree to use, two reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or practice complete abstinence (True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence [eg calendar, ovulation, symptothermal or post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) from heterosexual contact during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting lenalidomid; 2) while taking lenalidomide;   3) during dose interruptions; and 4) for at least 28 days after thelast dose of lenalidomide.. The two methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective method and one additional effective (barrier) method. If the below contraception methods are not appropriate for the FCBP, she must be referred to a qualified provider of contraception methods to determine the medically effective contraception method appropriate to the subject. The following are examples of highly effective and additional effective methods of contraception
•Examples of highly effective methods:
	Intrauterine device (IUD)
	Hormonal (birth control pills, injections, implants, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system [IUS], medroxyprogesterone acetate depot injections, ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills [e.g. desogestrel])

The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10 to 14 days prior to the start of lenalidomide and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior to the start of lenalidomide. The subject may not receive lenalidomide until the study doctor has verified that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative. . This requirement also applies to women of childbearing potential who practice complete and continued abstinence.
•	Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test weekly for the first 28 days of study participation and every 4 weeks while taking lenalidomide, at study discontinuation, and at day 28 following the last dose of lenalidomide. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 28 days and then every 14 days whiletaking lenalidomide, at study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28 following the last dose of lenalidomide.

Patient who is in the 1-month exclusion period of a previous study or participating to another clinical trial during this study,	
Patient who has a history of major medical/psychiatric illness or surgery which, in the judgment of the investigator, may interfere with study medication metabolism and/or study implementation and/or study parameter assessment,	
Patient who has forfeited his freedom by administrative or legal award, or who is under guardianship, or who has been admitted to a sanitary or social institution, or who is in an emergency situation.
E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): - Penile response evaluated with an Erection Assessment 5 point scale:
1 = no response (flaccidity),·	
2 = some enlargement (not likely to be sufficient for penetration)·	
3 = full enlargement (but insufficient rigidity),·	
4 = erection sufficient for vaginal penetration but not fully rigid·	
5 = full rigidity
The response will be evaluated by the investigator.The evaluation will be made immediately before the administration of each dose topical formulation and 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes thereafter.Before the application of the product the penile response score must be at 1 (score = 1 as flaccidity) on the Erection Assessment Scale.

- Percentage of patient with an improvement of at least 3 points as compared to the baseline (score = 1 as flaccidity) on the Erection Assessment Scale

- Latency and duration of the response:
mean time to onset of response (min)	
mean time to maximal response (min)	
mean time to return to non-erect state (min)

E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: It is the overriding objective to study the optimal vaccination strategy in 2nd - 3rd trimester pregnant women with the objectives to:
•	Assess whether the adjuvanted vaccine offers a meaningful benefit in pregnant women in terms of immune response over the non-adjuvanted vaccine, and if so, whether a low dose adjuvanted vaccine is sufficient. 
•	Assess the persistence of immune response over a 15 month time period after one single vaccination of the pregnant mother.
•	Gain insight on safety of the Novartis egg-based MF59 adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine Focetria in pregnant women and their babies. 


E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: Assess the maternally transferred specific antibodies against H1N1v in the newborn. 

Assess whether the immune response to H1N1 in pregnant women is different from that of non-pregnant women of similar age.
E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria
•	Healthy pregnant and non-pregnant women living in Eastern Denmark
•	Fluent in Danish

E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: •	Heart disease, endocrine disease, tuberculosis and sarcoidosis.
•	History of any anaphylaxis, serious vaccine reactions, or hypersensitivity to influenza viral proteins, to any excipients, and to eggs (including ovalbumin), and chicken proteins

E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): The immunogenicity criteria for success, as determined by HI, related to the EMEA/CPMP/VEG/4717/2003-Rev.1 (pandemic guideline) and EMEA/CHMP/VWP/263499/2006 (pre-pandemic guideline) are:
For adults subjects aged 18-60 years:
•	The percentage of subjects with seroconversion or significant increase in HI antibody is > 40% 
•	The percentage of subjects achieving an HI titer ≥40 is > 70%  
•	The GMR is >2.5
The assessment of criteria is based on the corresponding proportions and geometric means ratio empirically found (i.e. on the point estimates).

•proportion of subjects achieving a PASI90 response in the subgroup of subjects who have ≥3% skin involvement with psoriasis
-The improvement from baseline on secukinumab 75 or 150 or 300mg is superior to placebo for the 
•DAS28-CRP at W24
•SF36-PCS at W24
•HAQ-DI at W24
- The efficacy of secukinumab 75 or 150 or 300mg at W24 is superior to placebo based on the proportion of subjects achieving an ACR50 response
- The efficacy of secukinumab pooled regimen (75,150 and 300mg) at W24 is superior to placebo based on the 
•proportion of subjects with dactylitis in the subset of subjects who have dactylitis at baseline

E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation
E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) in Blast Phase
E.1.1.1 Medical condition in easily understood language: CML is a cancer of the white blood cells which build up, disrupting the normal balance of cells in the blood and bone marrow. In Blast phase, the cancer invades the bone marrow and other organs.
E.1.1.2 Therapeutic area: Diseases [C] - Cancer [C04]
MedDRA Classification
E.1.2 Medical condition or disease under investigation:
E.1.2 Version: 20.1
E.1.2 Level: PT
E.1.2 Classification code: 10009013
E.1.2 Term: Chronic myeloid leukaemia
E.1.2 System Organ Class: 10029104 - Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps)
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: The aim of this trial is to find a safe and effective dose of a drug called Ponatinib when used in combination with chemotherapy in patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) whose disease has moved in to blast phase.
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: To find out how safe it is to treat patients in Blast Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia with ponatinib and chemotherapy. To find out how effective this combination (ponatinib and chemotherapy) is by the end of the trial, to find out how good ponatinib is at maintaining a response to treatment once the combination (ponatinib and chemotherapy) treatment has ended (and after Stem Cell Transplant - if applicable to the patient), and how long that response can be maintained (i.e. until the patients leukaemia relapses or progresses).

E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: Yes
E.2.3.1 Full title, date and version of each sub-study and their related objectives: 1. Blood Sample Collection for Biobank
Objective: To study biology of blast crisis CML (genetic, epigenetic, proteomic, metabolomic etc.) and assess drug sensitivity/insensitivity.
Chronic myeloid leukaemia provides several tractable clinical and laboratory characteristics that allow us to study response to therapy at a clonal level – particularly the ability to grow colonies which contain sufficient numbers of cells for simultaneous genotyping and phenotypic analyses. Blood samples collected in this study will also be used to undertake genome-wide characterisation of patient-specific features that determine response and resistance to therapy. It is proposed to use respectively high-throughput sequencing, transcriptional profiling (at clonal level), epigenetic approaches and signalling studies to characterise patient-specific factors that determine response to therapy. By focusing on samples from patients in a prospective clinical trial and integrating results, genome-wide insights into the patient-specific genetic and epigenetic factors that determine response to treatment can be achieved.
All projects requesting cells from the Biobank will require approval from the NCRI CML Working Party before samples can be released to the researcher. 

2. Buccal Cell Sample collection for Biobank
Objective: To study biology of blast crisis CML (genetic, epigenetic, proteomic, metabolomic etc)
A sample of buccal cells will be requested at baseline. If this sample proves insufficient to analyse, a further sample of constitutional DNA (hair follicle) will be requested at a later date if the patient consents. 
This sample should be shipped to the Biobank with the baseline blood. 
All projects requesting cells from the Biobank will require approval from the NCRI CML Working Party before samples can be released to the researcher.

E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): Tolerability; Identification of the dose of ponatinib that can be safely delivered in combination with chemotherapy (FLAG-IDA) is defined in terms of dose limiting toxicities.
Dose Limiting Toxicity will be defined as:
•	Before the start of the second cycle of combination therapy or up to 8 weeks from the start of the first cycle of combination therapy, whichever is sooner: 
o	Grade 3 or 4 clinically significant non-haematological toxicity that cannot be managed with optimal medical care and that in the opinion of the investigator is related to the ponatinib and is likely to endanger the life of the patient or result in long term effects
o	Pancreatitis grade 2 or above
o	Increased serum  amylase grade 3 or 4*
o	Prolongation of the QT interval grade 3 or 4
o	Myocardial infarction
o	Stroke
o	Development or progression of a thromboembotic event requiring revascularisation
o	Unprovoked venous thromboembolism 

•	Toxicities will be measured and graded according to Version 4 CTCAE criteria.

*In cases where the patient displays an increased serum amylase level but no clinical signs of pancreatitis, please test the pancreatic isoenzyme level to differentiate between pancreatic and salivary amylase levels. If the pancreatic amylase level is within the ULN but the salivary amylase level is not, this would not be classified as a DLT and treatment may continue. Similarly, some ethnic populations, particularly African individuals may display a high normal level of amylase due to salivary amylase as opposed to pancreatic amylase. It is recommended to test isoenzyme levels to confirm if this is the case.

Efficacy: Haematological response (HR) or cytogenetic response (CyR) 
HR is defined as achieving all the following criteria:
Platelets >50x10^9/L (unsupported)
Neutrophils >1.0 x10^9/L (unsupported)
Blasts < 5% peripheral blood and bone marrow (where assessable)

CyR is defined as achieving at least a minor cytogenetic response (i.e. <65 % Ph+ cells)

An assessment for the primary outcome measure must be conducted prior to commencing the 2nd cycle of therapy. This can be at any time from 4-8 weeks after commencing combination therapy following haematological recovery to at least neutrophils ≥1.0x10^9/L and Platelets ≥ 50 x10^9/L. An assessment should be carried out at 8 weeks after commencing combination therapy if haematological recovery is not achieved.  
Given the heterogeneity of blast crisis CML and the advanced stage of disease, there may be instances of DLTs or reports of efficacy (as defined above) that occur outside of the 8 week period. If such events occur outside of the 8 week period but prior to the TSC meeting being conducted, the events will be formally reported to the TSC to take into consideration during their review of each patient. 

Cumulative reports of safety and efficacy from previously enrolled patients will also be reported to the TSC for consideration.

Patients who are unable to be formally evaluated for tolerability and efficacy due to withdrawal, treatment discontinuation or death, that is unrelated to treatment, before commencing the second cycle of therapy, may be replaced depending on the nature of the withdrawal/discontinuation. The trials office will notify centres of any patient replacement.

If a patient is evaluable for the tolerability outcome but not the efficacy outcome, the efficacy outcome may be inferred, as described in Section 12.1.1.1.
E.5.1.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: 2 cycles (8-16 weeks) of ponatinib in combination with chemotherapy (FLAG-IDA) for the tolerability/efficacy
1 cycle (4-8 weeks)for the dose limiting toxicities
1 cycle (4-8 weeks)for the efficacy
E.5.2 Secondary end point(s): •	Toxicity profile of ponatinib + chemotherapy (FLAG-IDA) within 6 months or up to transplant (whichever time point arrives first). Toxicities will be measured and graded according to the CTCAE criteria version 4.
•	Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) within 2 cycles of treatment
•	Major Molecular Response (MMR) within 2 cycles of treatment
•	Haematological response within 2 cycles of treatment 
•	3 year disease free survival (DFS)
•	3 year overall survival (OS)
•	1 and 3 year relapse rate post allogeneic transplant or maintenance therapy
•	1 and 3 year treatment related mortality
•	Incidence of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation rate and Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) post-transplant 

E.5.2.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: 6 months for toxicity profile of ponatinib and chemotherapy
8-16 weeks for complete cytogenetic response
8-16 weeks for haematological response
8-16 weeks for major molecular response
3 years for disease free survival and overall survival
1 year and 3 years for the relapse rates and mortality
Any GVHD that happens within the first 100 days after SCT is considered acute GVHD (aGVHD). GVHD occurring after 100 days post-SCT is termed chronic GVHD (cGVHD).
